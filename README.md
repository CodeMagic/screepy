# CodeMagic's Screepy AI

Generated from the Screeps Typescript Starter, this is my code for running screeps. I hope to maintain multiple branches, to experiment with different approaches.

## This Branch: Boids

Seems like a lot of open-source screeps controllers take a heirarchical approach, with task management and lots of Memory usage.

I'm wondering if I can get my creeps working more like boids; a swarm of entities following simple rules to create emergent behavior.

Granted, the scope of what screeps creeps must do is much greater than a boids simulation. But if an ant colony can run without a heirarchy, why not screeps?

## Basic Usage

For basic usage of the [screeps-typescript-starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter) framework, see that repo.
